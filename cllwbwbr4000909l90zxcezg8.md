As a developer, We are taking a lot from Open source, Hence, give our share back to open source!

In this post, We will concentrate only on identifying the active projects in the open-source community. There are many ways followed by the developers. But, This is my style of identifying open-source projects to contribute. This is what I recommend to peers who stepping into the world of open source.

We may come across some times in life to contribute something to open source, so we actively read some blogs, watch YouTube videos about the contribution and open the famous repos hosted sites like GitHub and stumble upon the number of projects and reports. The same happened to me as well.

We may quickly hob into some of the projects that may be there but not very active in development. Some projects might be “Archived” by the maintainers. In some cases, projects will align with your interests but not matching with your skill set. These factors might affect the newcomers to the open source contribution motivation. To solve the initial open source contributor facing beginner problem, This blog comes with one of the simplest ways to tackle this situation.

**Disclaimer:** I'm not promoting any products, Just blogging my experiences in an open-source journey.

First, Search for “Google Summer of code past programs” and open the first result.

Now select the year you wish to view the programs. I'm selecting “2022 programs” for the article's purpose.

Here we have a list of organizations that are active in the open-source community.

Here I'm selecting one project named “Audacity” which is a platform for audio software. (My interests revolve around Multimedia software development). Similarly, you can choose interest-aligned projects.

Now you can read about the project descriptions and visit their official site.

Since it is an Open Source product, they mostly have a dedicated page for the developers which will have most of the details related to bug tracking, development instructions, Source code, community communication channels/apps/mailing list and other important information.
