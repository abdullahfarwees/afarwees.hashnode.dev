My experience in using the Code analysis programs during my development and reviewing the peer's code.

**Code reviewer life BEFORE using the Code analysis programs:**

A developer usually writes lines and lines of code and does some testing to suit the coded logic as expected. After all this work, A developer will raise a pull request to merge into the Master branch in their git host sites.

A code reviewer will look into the basics of standards followed in the source code and merge if all the requirements are met. If he is too busy or needs to review a lot of code, then he has to do the coding standard step carefully and needs to do the code review. As a human, it is a time-consuming task to review peer developers coding standards and maintain the code quality in the project if there are many tasks of code reviewing and suggesting.

There is a famous saying in `Software field` \- "If there is a logic, then there is a scope of optimization. If there is a repeated task, there is a scope of automation"

**Code reviewer life AFTER coding analysis program**

A code analyzer program is hosted in the cloud or local developer system. This becomes very handy which will take care lot of the basic coding standards. This program saves tons and tons of time for reviewers. Whenever the developer raises a PR, An automated code analysis starts scanning the program and suggests a list of improvement areas, security holes, unwanted lines of code, unused variables, unreachable lines of code and repeated code lines, etc., are shown explicitly. This becomes very useful for the developer to correct the above code corrections. Also, in the long term, it helps the developer to incorporate the quality of code in their daily coding styles.
