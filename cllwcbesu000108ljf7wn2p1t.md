This is not a only guide, but this is my style of identifying and recommending to my peers to start the simple issues to get familiar with the open source contribution and make small successes which bring a lot of confidence, motivation and happiness.

Nowadays, there are many ways to find the issues that are time-consuming and demotivating factors (sometimes) to newcomers. But, In GitHub, there are simple ways and power results can be obtained.

First, visit and log in to the GitHub account. On the top search bar, type **issue:"good first issue”** **issue:"newcomer”** or **issues"low-hanging”** or **label:good-first-issue.** This will bring a huge number of issues labelled as “good first issues” which is the best for beginners to work on.

By looking at the result of 12800 issues might cause confusion about where to start for beginners. Don't worry, We cover those aspects in the below section.

Second, It is time to filter out the result according to the need. Here we followed 4 steps to refine the search result.

step 1: Add the language of your choice. For example, **language:C++** will bring the C++ project issues alone.

step 2: On the “Filter by”, select the “Issues type”. This will strictly refine the issues from the project.

step 3: On the “State” select “Open”. This will show only Open issues and hide the issues that are in a closed state.

step 4: \[optional\] Select the drop-down and select the items based on the requirements. For this blog, I chose the “newest” which will give the latest issues in the list.
