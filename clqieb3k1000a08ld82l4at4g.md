I was exploring the GitHub projects and the Tessel project caught my attention. Their introductions are informative and want to dive into the project. First tried reaching out to their website to know more about the project but their site is down (Later, this is raised as an issue by one of the contributors).

Now I want to reach out to the maintainer to know more about the status of the project and tried to connect via Slack channel. But it is not available. Thus, later realized that the project maintainers were not active. I recognized the need for clarity regarding its current status. Despite the website being down and the Slack channel inactive,

Hence, I was determined to ensure that potential newcomers wouldn't encounter the same confusion I did., I promptly raised a ticket in GitHub and requested the maintainer to update the current status of the project. This will help the newcomers to know the live status of the project.

If you also come across these kinds of projects where they are not very active for a long time and you don't want the newcomers to get confused, you can request the maintainers kindly to update the current status of the project. This remained me of the famous saying
