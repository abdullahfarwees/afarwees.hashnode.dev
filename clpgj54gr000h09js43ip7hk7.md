Already wrote a blog about identifying the projects and contributing to the first issues.

This article shows how to find the projects to work on. Read here…

This article shows the simple way to find the “good first issue” in GitHub itself.

But this article can be considered as a continuation of the above and adds some more ways to find the best starting issues for newcomers.

Note that these are not the only ways to work. But this is my style of identifying the issues and mostly recommend this way to my peers. There are many sites which are offering great service to newcomers. Kudos to their hard work and efforts. Here I recommend 4 websites that help to identify the “good first issues”

They have the filter of choosing the language, label, tags, star count, etc.

Here is the list for you
