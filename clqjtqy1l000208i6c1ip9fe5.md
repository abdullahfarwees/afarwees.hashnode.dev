After posted this blog, I got messages from various readers regarding their contributions, which made me HAPPYYYY and sometimes sad at the same moment. Some people are making minor contributions and stopping their contributions or updating their profiles as Open Source contributors! This is an appreciable effort But it is the right moment to share the other crucial information which might help them to achieve new heights!

*“There are many opportunities to contribute to the project at any level. Every contribution is highly valued and no contribution is too small.” - Royal OBrien \[O3DE - Director\]*

The author(myself) recounts their experience on GitHub, where they discovered the project related to the RTSP stream. Upon noticing misspelt words in the project documentation, they promptly raised an issue, and subsequently, they forked the project, corrected the errors in the "[README.md](http://README.md)" file, and submitted a pull request (PR) to the original repository. The PR was eventually merged into the master repository by the project maintainer without setting up the project development in the development system.

The blog's aim is to give a kick-start to the open-source contribution.

The above article shows how to start the open source contribution. But these types of contributions should NOT be considered as achieved success neither by us nor by the organization. Of course, your single small efforts are appreciable, but that’s not the end of the contribution. We should strive for the best work and contribute more than the previous work. This kind of attitude helps us to learn, grow and contribute a lot.

The actual contribution should involve solving critical bugs, creating new features, enhancing functionality, optimizing the existing functionality, and collaborating with team members towards a single goal recognized by the organizations. Apart from these activities, Our mindset should work towards contribution of the others to make other's lives better is the MATTERED THE MOST !!.
