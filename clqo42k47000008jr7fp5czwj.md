**Reading the issue carefully**

As a newbie to the 03DE project, hence explored the ‘easy-fix’ issue and found this issue. There was a recent URL update in their host and it is not still updated in their source code link. It was posted by on of the contributors and left this task for newcomers.

[https://github.com/o3de/o3de/issues/16335](https://github.com/o3de/o3de/issues/16335)

After confirming the issue, quickly set up the build environment in my dev system and searched for the link location in the source code.

Later, replaced the updated URL and raised the pull request. It was reviewed by the two contributors. [https://github.com/o3de/o3de/pull/16538](https://github.com/o3de/o3de/pull/16538)
